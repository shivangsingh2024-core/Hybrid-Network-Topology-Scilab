Network Topology Creation using Scilab – Hybrid Topology
# Hybrid Network Topology using Scilab

## Aim
To design and analyze a hybrid network topology using Scilab by combining
basic network topologies such as Star, Ring, and Mesh.

## Software Used
- Scilab 6.0.0
- Windows OS

## Description
This project creates a hybrid network topology consisting of:
- Star Topology (Nodes 1–10)
- Ring Topology (Nodes 11–18)
- Mesh Topology (Nodes 19–25)

The topology is created using Scilab scripting and visualized using
graph plotting techniques.

## Operations Performed
- Display of hybrid network topology
- Numbering of nodes and edges
- Calculation of total nodes and edges
- Degree of each node
- Identification of node with maximum degree

## Files Included
- hybrid_topology.sce : Scilab source code
- Network_Topology_Scilab.docx : Experiment report with code and output

## Result
The hybrid topology with 25 nodes was successfully created and analyzed.
The node with the maximum number of connections was identified.
